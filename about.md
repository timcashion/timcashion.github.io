I am currently a Data Scientist at Bio Conscious Technologies. I am passionate about applying my data analysis and data science skills to practical problems.  

I recently finished my PhD in Oceans and Fisheries at UBC incorporating econometric models, large-scale fisheries conservation datasets, and ecosystem modeling.     

In my spare time, I run on roads and trails and look for beers I haven't tried.
