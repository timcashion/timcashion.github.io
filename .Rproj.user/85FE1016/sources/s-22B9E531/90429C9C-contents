My name is Tim Cashion and I am currently a PhD candidate at UBC at the Insitute for the Oceans and Fisheries. My main research focus is data and synthesis studies to improve our understanding of fisheries and conservation issues. In my spare time, I run on roads and trails and look for beers I haven't tried.
