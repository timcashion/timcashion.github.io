Just a quick post after a half day project today.

**Coefficient Strength from Logistic Regression Model**



I started the day by downloading a dataset on customer churn from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

  
I was able to test out some different models (logistic regression, random forest, neural net) and will get to the hyperparameter optimization on a later day. 
  
Random Forest and SVM are **SEVERLY** overfitting to the training data. 


| Model type          | train_error | test_error |
|---------------------|-------------|------------|
| dummy               | 0.3826      | 0.403      |
| Logistic regression | 0.1935      | 0.2068     |
| RBF SVM             | 0.0704      | 0.2281     |
| random forest       | 0.0145      | 0.2161     |
| neural net          | 0.192       | 0.2104     |


   
After that, I made a quick visual for the interepretation side of the results (see above). It's not helpful to predict churn if we can't do anything about it, or know what to do about it. Clearly, customers in long-term contracts (1-2 years) are highly unlikely to leave. I'm not sure what the connection between Fibre Optic Internet and Churn is but there is definitely some strong correlations here. Would be interesting to look into this more another day.

You can find my ongoing work on this mini-project  [here](https://github.com/timcashion/churn_analysis). 

Challenges to further improvements:
- The dataset is fairly limited on who the customers are. Other personal features (employment type, age, etc.) would help in prediction of churn here
