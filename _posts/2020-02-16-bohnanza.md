Rio Grande Games has a great game called
[Bohnanza](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008URUS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00008URUS&linkCode=as2&tag=tcashion-20&linkId=20a522f051ebafd8d5e367eb94d6a1b9).
The objective of the game is to make the most money by planting
different bean fields, where different types of beans require a
different number of beans to get to the next value level. There are 4
values levels (of 1, 2, 3, and 4 coins) in the game with not every type
of bean having each level. Different beans have different frequencies in
the deck which roughly correspond to how many of them you need to plant
to get to the next level of value.   


*Data collection. Large number on the card is the bean’s frequency in the deck, with the different point levels below indicated by a stack of 1 to 4 coins.*

*Bean types with their frequency and number of beans needed to reach different point levels.*  
| Type       | Frequency | P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 |  
|------------|-----------|----|----|----|----|  
| Coffee     | 24        | 4  | 7  | 10 | 12 |  
| Wax        | 22        | 4  | 7  | 9  | 11 |  
| Blue       | 20        | 4  | 6  | 8  | 10 |  
| Chili      | 18        | 3  | 6  | 8  | 9  |  
| Stink      | 16        | 3  | 5  | 7  | 8  |  
| Green      | 14        | 3  | 5  | 6  | 7  |  
| Soy        | 12        | 2  | 4  | 6  | 7  |  
| Black-eyed | 10        | 2  | 4  | 5  | 6  |  
| Red        | 8         | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |  
| Garden     | 6         | 0  | 2  | 3  | 0  |  
| Cocoa      | 4         | 0  | 2  | 3  | 4  |  

We assume this relationship roughly exists with as frequency decreases
value (or value per card) increases. We calculate value per card as the
number of coins divided by the number of bean cards needed to reach that
level. We can then plot this with a regression line overlaid and see it
is roughly linear relationship.

*Linear relationship between frequency and value per card.*

Because it takes you different amount of cards to get to the different
point levels of each bean type, I assumed it was unlikely that they were
balanced perfectly. So, if you could find which cards have higher
probability of getting to the different coin levels first, you could
exploit this to beat your friends at the game.

From here, I calculated the conditional probability of getting to each
level. I assumed you would not be replacing the cards in the deck after
one is drawn (which makes sense for the first round of the game). So the
conditional probability is P(A) \* P(B|A), where P(A) is the probability
of drawing the first bean of a certain type, and P(B|A) is the
probability of drawing another bean of that type. I continue this on to
reach the different numbers of beans required for each point level
(which ranges from 2 beans to 12 beans).

For example, to get 2 coins from a coffee bean farm you need 7 coffee
beans. The probability of that is:   
24/154 \* 23/153 \* 22/152 \* 21/151 \* 20/150 \* 19/149 \* 18/148 = 9.75e-07

When we plot this out with probability on the x-axis and point values on
the y-axis it looks like this:

*Probability of achieving goal vs Coins.*   


But what we should look for is the beans at the right end of each
different point level as ‘best performers’ and the the beans at the left
end of each level as ‘worst performers’. From this, we can see that the
odds of getting to a top level of the coffee bean (3 or 4 coins) is VERY
LOW, even though they are super common in the deck (~16% of the deck at
the start). And if you want to just get to the first coin level as easy
as possible, the Soy Bean is the way to go.

I think there are some other metrics that could synthesize the
trade-offs between value per card, expected return, and probability, but
this is still a work in progress. If you have any ideas, feel free to
reach out or build on the analysis yourself. All code is available
